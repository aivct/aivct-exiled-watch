# Exiled Watch (Working Title)
An in-development web game about designing soldiers.
- The goal is to create a game where you will be able to design individual classes of soldiers in the same way that you can design airships or tanks.

Thematically very loosely inspired by AGOT's the night's watch. Mechanically inspired by the game *The Last Spell* and the Wesnoth Mod *Cities of the Frontier*.

Currently in the middle of an endless overhaul involving ripping out the guts of most mechanics.
